# React_Little_Card_Game

A card has two sides, front and back. Front side is a word in a language other than English. Back side is the same word in English. 

All cards with same language belong to one deck. You can add a card to a deck. You can also add a new deck of cards in a different language.

Reviewing a deck puts on a quiz, the question is either a front side or back side of a card, you have four choices to guess which is the corresponding opposite side. It will tell you if your choice is correct after clicking an answer.

The quiz continues till the exhaustion of all cards in a deck or when you click stop. A summary of a percentage of the correct answers is given at the end if it is not ended manually.
